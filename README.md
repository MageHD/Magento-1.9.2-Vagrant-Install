# Magento-1.9.2-Vagrant-Install
It just works!!
A vagrant box that will create a vanilla Magento 1.9 installation including sample data. Compliments of Scotchbox and Magerun.

1. Clone the repository into your project folder.
2. Edit the Vagrant file to reflect your domain name and ip address. (IP address must be unique)
3. Run the command "vagrant up". 
4. Navigate to the domain you specified and Voila a Local Magento development environment.
